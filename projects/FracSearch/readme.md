Finds Fractional Permutation Polynomials in the form f(x)/g(x)

Normalization:
GCD(f(x), g(x)) = 1
f(x) and g(x) are monic
f(0) = 0, g(0) != 0
if prime does not divide the degree of g(x), second coefficient of g(x) is 0

# FracSearch

**FracSearch** is a Java program designed to search for permutation polynomials of fractional form over finite fields using Hermiteâ€™s Criterion. It tests candidate polynomials of the form `f(x)/g(x)` over `GF(p^r)` with specified degrees and constraints, reporting which ones are valid permutation polynomials.
